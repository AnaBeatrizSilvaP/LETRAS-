Walking in the dark, now I jam some cookies
Which is not for you, I know it's not
And I just can't explain, it's melts in my mouth
Dying to me, now is popcorn

Can't you understand?
Can't you understand, boy?
So shake your head
So shake your head, sucker

(No!)

So shake your head
So shake your head, sucker, no!

So shake your head, sucker
